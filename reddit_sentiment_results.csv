Alibaba unveils homegrown AI chip to replace Nvidia’s H20 in China,"No paywall: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-alibaba-develops-ai-chip-090846681.html

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

Separately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",770,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n350ak/alibaba_unveils_homegrown_ai_chip_to_replace/,POSITIVE,0.9918155074119568,neutral,0.7805211544036865

"Ormat technologies (ORA) has the macro, the micro, and the management to scale rapidly.","Ormat Technologies (ORA) has the macro, the micro, and the management to grow rapidly.

Ormat is a geothermal company that does everything in house.  They find geothermal deposits, build the power plants using equipment they built themselves, and then operate the power plants.  As of writing, they have around 2 gigawatts of production spread across the globe, only 10% of which is in the US.  That number is going to get a whole hell of a lot larger.  I'm sure you can guess at least part of the reason why.

It's AI. AI requires power, geothermal is baseload power that isn't vulnerable to fuel price fluctuations, yadda yadda, you heard this 50 gorillian times before.  What you probably haven't heard is the tax incentives.  The big beautiful bill extended the tax credit for geothermal power out to 2032 and reinstated 100% bonus depreciation.  Combined, any geothermal plant built before 2032 will get 50% of the capex back in tax incentives.  Then, once the plant is operational, they can deduct 15% of their net income because of percentage depletion (another tax thing).  That's great an all, but that doesn't solve geothermal's fundamental problem with scaling.  Geothermal plants can only be built in certain areas, and all the money in the world won't change that.  Well, that's where enhanced geothermal energy comes in.  Enhanced geothermal energy is pretty much the geothermal equivalent of fracking, and allows for geothermal plants to be built almost anywhere.  The tech for that is still new, but enhanced geothermal plants have been built and run successfully, allowing geothermal to scale beyond it's previous constraints.

So why geothermal instead of nuclear?  Firstly, they aren't mutually exclusive, but there are some reasons to choose geothermal.  It isn't reliant on uranium prices, which as all the regards in UUUU should know are prone to wild fluctuations.  A fuel source that can go from 20 dollars a pound to 100 dollars a pound in 7 years obviously isn't great when trying to determine how feasible a project is.  Then, there's the construction time.  Geothermal plants take about 2 years to build and, after some fresh legislation, take about a month or two.  Nuclear plants take about twice the time to build, and roughly the same amount of time to permit.  Then there's the stigma of nuclear, which geothermal doesn't really have.  For AI companies scrambling to grow as fast as possible those 2 years and no worry of NIMBYism will make a large difference.  

So that's geothermal as a whole, but why Ormat in particular?  Ormat is one of if not the largest geothermal companies, with 50 years of experience and around 1.5 gigawatts of power production spread across six continents and 30 countries. They are completely vertically integrated, prospecting, building, and operating their plants using equipment they built themselves.  That last part is particularly important, as Ormat also sells their equipment to other geothermal companies, and stand to benefit from the tariffs making Chinese drilling equipment uneconomical.  Other geothermal companies will be left with the choice of starting their own equipment manufacturing wing, buying from Ormat, or paying extra for Chinese stuff.  Whatever they chose, Ormat benefits, either by gaining market share from competitors delaying their projects, spending more on their projects, or by getting more sales.  Ormat also has a energy storage division, and energy storage is rather important for when energy demand fluctuates.  All of this combines to create a golden opportunity, an opportunity Ormat's management is pouncing on.

Ormat has radically increased the rate that they are issuing debt and spending on capex.  Because geothermal is such a stable industry, they can get cheap debt and have a WACC of 4.95%.  They've also made some new hires, most notable of which is Daniel Moelk.  He was appointed senior vice president and brings experience with enhanced geothermal energy.  

TLDR: AI means more energy demand, enhanced geothermal energy means geothermal can scale now, there's a shit ton of tax incentives, and Ormat can and is taking advantage of all three.

Like… in my opinion everything - I mean EVERYTHING is f’king luck. Born human instead of a pig = luck. Born in a family that feeds you 3 meals a day instead of starving = luck. Being alive today and the fact I woke up alive this morning = luck…

$TH - Prepare Your Backdoors for this Sneaky AI/Critical Minerals 10 Bagger,"**TL;DR** Target Hospitality Corp. (**$TH**) now has booked contracts serving the AI datacenter infrastructure AND critical minerals industries, which are everyone’s two favorite dragons to chase right now. Calls are cheap, with an IV around 40%. With recent announcements,  $TH stock price is lower than it was in January, it has a $900 million market cap, but options are priced like a boring big-cap boomer stock.

There’s big upside on calls if market wakes up to this new reality and it makes a run to the most recent analyst target of $11. If that happens, calls are anywhere from a 3 to 10 bagger depending on how you play it. There’s even more upside if $TH picks up some heat and IV expands. And if it really runs, things will get silly quickly. We're talking 20 or 30 bagger potential  



I’m long a bunch of September and October 10c.

**The Setup**

I love a good setup, like my [Gambling on Peace play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mr7gal/gambling_on_peace/), betting on the coincidence that $KIEV ticker going live the same day that Trump met with Putin would result in the stock popping. That setup was based on $KIEV being a proxy for geopolitical progress, and it did in fact go on a nice run the following week, as I expected.

But, unlike that play, $TH is primed for a run based on business fundamentals, the market mispricing options, and $TH having mostly unnoticed exposure to hot sectors. Allow me to explain.

We all know anything within a whiff of AI infrastructure or critical minerals has gone on an absolute tear this year. (Looking at you APLD, MP, UUUU, and a bunch of small caps I can’t mention here.) That’s because there’s been an absolute stampede by giant tech companies to build a fuck ton of data centers, and the Trump administration has a giant boner for building out critical mineral supply chains in the US.

$TH just happens to have large service contracts supporting the buildout on both of these initiatives. And I think there‘s more in the works. That combined with the $TH having underpriced options means we’ve got the setup for multi-bagger in a conservative bull case, and a 10+ bagger if it really gains traction. (Sept and Oct 10c have been filling for .1 and .2, respectively. Sometimes lower.)

Ask ChatGPT “option low IV good?” if you’re not familiar with options pricing.

**The Backdoor AI Datacenter Play**

On August 18^(th), $TH announced a $43 million dollar contract supporting the buildout of a datacenter in the Southwest US. This puts them firmly in the picks-and-shovels-for-AI-infrastructure business. Analyst Stephen Gengaro from Stifel called $TH a “**back door data center play**” along with his recent price target of $11.

I think there’s going to be a lot more datacenter revenue in the future. But don’t listen to me, here’s $TH CEO Brad Archer on the datacenter contract and landscape:

>""We are excited to announce this contract and the continued progress on our strategic initiatives. This contract broadens our customer reach and further illustrates our ability to deliver comprehensive hospitality solutions across diverse commercial end‑markets. Our unique capabilities provide a critical solution supporting this **growing end‑market demand**, and we believe there are **additional opportunities to participate in the rapidly expanding technology infrastructure** **transformation**..""

**Translation:** They’re about to be tits deep in an overflowing pool of that sweet AI infrastructure revenue.

**Why settle for one backdoor when you can have two?**

What if you’re a greedy little regard who isn’t satisfied by one backdoor? Well, fellow degenerate, I have good news for you! $TH is also a backdoor play into the critical minerals boom. A picks-and-shovels-for-picks-and-shovels play, if you will. (I’ll see myself out.)

In February of this year, $TH announced a $143 million contract partnering with Lithium Americas at the Thacker Pass lithium project. And they see this as just the beginning for their critical minerals business. Here’s $TH CEO Brad Archer again, this time on this contract:

>“We are excited to announce this partnership with Lithium Americas and support the critical development of a domestic lithium supply chain. This marks a significant milestone in Target's commitment to strategic diversification, while simultaneously expanding our geographic presence. We believe the establishment of **this community will provide opportunities to pursue additional value‑enhancing growth initiatives supporting an expanding number of large, critical mineral development projects** in the region.”

**Translation:** Strap on your hardhats boys, we’re about to be digging up more critical minerals tendies!

**The Company**

At this point you may be feeling that tingle in your jingles telling you to FOMO your life savings into short-dated calls (please don’t). But first, maybe you’re wondering, “what the fuck does this company even do?” That’s a great question, and I applaud the incredible depth of your DD skills.

$TH describes themselves as, “the largest US provider of accommodations, culinary and hospitality services.” Which is just as vague and corporate-y as you would expect from a public company’s website. What they really do, is build temporary living environments for people. The also providing the things people need to live in those environments, like food, water, laundry service, cages, etc.

Think of it this way. Remember when the Death Star got blown up at the end of A New Hope? And then the Empire went all-out rebuilding a new Death Star that showed up in Return of the Jedi? Well, they would have needed to bring in a bunch of outside contractors to rebuild the Death Star so quickly. If they operated in the Star Wars Universe, $TH would be the company providing the space pods for the contractors to live in, cooking up their protein goop dinners, cleaning their space suits, etc. And if the Empire won, they probably would have built the cages they kept the Ewoks in until they got deported. But that's pure speculation on my part.

**Wait, so are these guys kind of…evil?**

I’d consider them sort of evil adjacent. But this isn’t a UNICEF convention, it’s a casino. And, they’re doing less evil stuff since they had their migrant camp contracts cancelled. By revenue, I calculate that they’re now about **78% less evil** than before. And that’s why they’ve moved on from habitats (cages) for migrant children and families, to building worker camps (unlocked cages) for nerds building data centers and guys swinging pickaxes in mines. (OK I don’t really know how mining works.)

While we're on the topic of cancelled government contracts, you may notice the stock took an absolute nosedive earlier this year. Their biggest government contract was cancelled in February, causing the drop. That shakeup forced them to focus on non-government opportunities, and they've since replaced that lost revenue with critical minerals and data center contracts. They've also renewed a government contract that was cancelled in August 2024 (the Dilley Facility). However, stock price still hasn't fully rebounded to where it was in January.

How many companies have you seen that have AI and Critical Minerals exposure and the stock price is lower than it was in January? Well, now it's at least one. You're welcome.

$TH has been also been able to put those unused assets from their cancelled contracts back to work on new contracts. The $43 million dollar datacenter contract is only going to require about $6-9 million of Capex investment, because they’re reusing the assets from previous projects.

Lots of big potential projects with minimal Capex costs = rocket ship emoji.

**Conclusion**

Ok, this is mostly the TL;DR 2, electric boogaloo.

$TH has big upside due to their unique exposure to the critical minerals and AI  infrastructure sectors, with more opportunities coming. The stock is cheaper than it was in January. Options are also very cheap, so this is a multi-bagger (or more) on relatively small moves in the stock price. And they’re 78% less evil, if you care about that sort of thing.

Remember, play it with options while they’re still cheap. If IV triples maybe sit this one out. Or, do whatever you want. Maybe FOMO your life savings into it. I don't really care.  I’m not a financial advisor and this isn’t financial advice.

**Positions**

**Update -** added a shares position in my 401k. I like the short term and long term outlook here.
